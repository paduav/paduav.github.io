            <p>Entry #3 <br> First week down of my last semester and I've already been so busy that I can't believe it has almost been a month since my last write. A lot of things happened during that time though. In addition to my last entry about getting cool things, I got a new bike for free. My neighbor was throwing it out and didn't need it anymore. Surprisingly, the bike is in very good condition, couldn't even tell if it has been used at all. The bike is a 2005 Felt F80 road bike. Feels very nice to ride since it's so thin and light. It was just what I was looking for in a bike. I finished a roll of one of my Gold 200 film and sent it out to get it processed. Hopefully, my Olympus actually works. Might be a while until my next entry, but we'll see if my schedule ends up being manageable.  <br><br> End of Line.</p>

            <p>Entry #2 <br> Very cool find yesterday: an Olympus OM-10 camera. It's an 80s camera from Japan, so I'm pretty excited to learn all about it and finally get into photography. All I need now is film. The Kodak Gold 200s I bought should be coming in today. I wanted to start taking more pictures this year, so this was a great find. Looks like my resolutions for this year are off to a good start. <br><br> End of Line.</p>

            <p>First blog entry. Created this site today as part of my New Year's Resolutions. Wub is here too. Still trying to figure out what I want to do with this site and what I should fill it out with. I have some ideas in mind and I could just work on this on my free time, but for now I think a blog is a good way to start off. <br><br> End of Line.</p>

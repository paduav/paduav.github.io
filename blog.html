            <p>Entry #2 <br> Very cool find yesterday: an Olympus OM-10 camera. It's an 80s camera from Japan, so I'm pretty excited to learn all about it and finally get into photography. All I need now is film. The Kodak Gold 200s I bought should be coming in today. I wanted to start taking more pictures this year, so this was a great find. Looks like my resolutions for this year are off to a good start. <br><br> End of Line.</p>

            <p>First blog entry. Created this site today as part of my New Year's Resolutions. Wub is here too. Still trying to figure out what I want to do with this site and what I should fill it out with. I have some ideas in mind and I could just work on this on my free time, but for now I think a blog is a good way to start off. <br><br> End of Line.</p>

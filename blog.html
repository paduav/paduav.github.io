            <p>First blog entry. Created this site today as part of my New Year's Resolutions. Wub is here too. Still trying to figure out what I want to do with this site and what I should fill it out with. I have some ideas in mind and I could just work on this on my free time, but for now I think a blog is a good way to start off. <br><br> End of Line.</p>
